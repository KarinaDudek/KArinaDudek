### Junior Java Developer 

Hi! 
I am a naval architect who, at the age of 36, decided to reinvent myself and learn programming on my own.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning Java and have completed a Git course.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on projects where I can apply the knowledge I've learned and use my Java and Git skills.
- ðŸ¤” I am looking for help with further development as a Java developer. If you could recommend a course or book in this area I would be grateful.
